* TASKS [8/10]
** DONE extract dipoles from file
** DONE plot dipole vectors 
   - kinda ugly but technically done
   - hopefully improved by COM translation
   - scale might not need to be 2 for this, seems small
   - needs a better depiction, not scale problem
** DONE identify the center of mass of the molecule
** DONE translate the molecule to its center of mass 
** DONE also have to translate the dipole vectors by this
   - dip vector is origin -> dip
   - move the whole molecule -> origin += com
     and dip += com
** DONE determine moments of inertia to get rotation axes
** DONE plot the rotation axes
   - MOI eigenvectors (cols of ev matrix) are the axes, need to match
     them to the eigenvalues
   - maybe make these colors, original axes black
** TODO figure out how to represent everything pictorially
** TODO colored tubes for joining atoms
   - halfway from color, half to color
** TODO flag(s) for changing input orientation
   Handles:
   - identify plane of molecule, make that be plane of screen
** DONE plot axes
