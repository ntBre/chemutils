* Flags
  - flag for bzs vs bza - linear or not
    - BZS for linear
    - BZA for all others (but sometimes near linear needs BZS?)
  - flag for format of output: org, tex, etc

* DONE report geometrical data
  - want r(alpha) - vibrationally averaged data
  - also want r(equil) - equilibrium geometry
